Animal Quest v 0.8
Code and Assets by L G

Here's the 'completed' version of my game for my SWE100: Intro to Scripting.

Here's a run down of what you can do, and what happens.

You are a spirit of nature, and you must heal the sickened animals!

Animals will regain their color when they are cured.  To cure them you must fufill objectives.


When pressing "a" or :s" and occasionally "g", you will bring up a cursor that you can move around the grid.  To perform an action, simply press the key you used to bring up the cursor to begin with while highlighting the tile you wish to interact with.


You must cure the animals in a specific order, as follows:


=== Stag ===

 - The stag is afraid of the dark, use your spirit ability 'Illuminate', and then interact with the stag when it is in the area of your illuminate!

 - After healing the stag, you will gain the ability to turn into a stag using your "Invoke" function.


=== Wolf ===

 - There are two wolves placed on the grid, you can talk to either of them for a hint on how to help them.

 - To cure the wolves, you must move them so they are together with their other packmate!  You can do this using the stag's push ability (as a stag, just move into a creature to push it), or the carry ability (press g to bring up a cursor, target the creature to pick up, press g again.  You can then press g while carrying something to drop it in the same way!).

 - Once the wolves are cured, they will spawn a randomly placed meat object on the map.  This meat is used to help cure the rat.


=== Rat ===

 - The rat is hungry and would like some food.  You can spawn the food on the map by helping the wolves first.

 - You can use the wolf's passive ability "Track" to locate the food item on the map.  The food is invisible, but you will be notified by the game console when you draw close to the buried food.

 - You can use the look and interact buttons to scout for the location of the buried food while in wolf form.  If you successfully locate it, you will recieve a message telling you that something is there!

 - Once you find the location of the food, you can use the wolf's ability "dig" to unearth the food and reveal it!

 - Simply "interact" with the food item to add it to your inventory.  You can review what items you are carrying by pressing the "item" button.

 - Talk to the rat with the food in your inventory to cure it.


That's it, you're done!

Originally I wanted to add in rat abilities as well, but it would require AI coding and terrain/level design, which I simply don't have the time for at this moment.  Everything else is in place and seems to work well, however.


And lastly, thank you for playing!  I hope you enjoyed what was there.
